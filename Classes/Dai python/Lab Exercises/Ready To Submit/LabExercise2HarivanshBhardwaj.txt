# # Q6: The marks obtained by a student in 5 different Subjects are input through a keyboard. The Student gets a division as per the following rules.
# # 1.	Percentage above or equal to 60 – First Division
# # 2.	Percentage between 50 and 59 – Second Division
# # 3.	Percentage between 40 and 49 – Third Division
# # 4.	Percentage less than 40 – Fail
# # Write a python program to Display the result based on the above Criteria.

# Q8: Write a Python program to check if the input year is a leap year or not.

# Q10: Given a nested list. Write a python program to extend it with adding sub list ["h", "i", "j"] in a such a way that it will look like the following list
# Given List:
# list1 = ["a", "b", ["c", ["d", "e", ["f", "g"], "k"], "l"], "m", "n"]
# Sub List to be added = ["h", "i", "j"]
# Expected output:
# ['a', 'b', ['c', ['d', 'e', ['f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j'], 'k'], 'l'], 'm', 'n']


list1 = ["a", "b", ["c", ["d", "e", ["f", "g"], "k"], "l"], "m", "n"]

list1[2][1][2].append(sub)
print(list1)






# Q11: Write a python program for Given a Python list, to find value 20 in the list, and if it is present, replace it with 200. Only update the first occurrence of a value
list1 = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 20]
# Expected output:
# list1 = [5, 10, 15, 200, 25, 50, 20]


if 20 in list1:
    x= list1.index(20)
    list1[x]=200
    print(list1)





# Q12: Write a program to rotate a list to the right by k steps.


list1=[1,2,3,4,5]
k=1
x = list1[-(k) : ] + list1[  : -(k)]

print(x)
