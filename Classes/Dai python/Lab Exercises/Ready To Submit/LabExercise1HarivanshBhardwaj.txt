#Q1: Write a Python program which accept the radius of a circle from the user and compute the area.
#Sample Output : 
#r = 1.1
#Area = 3.8013271108436504
import math
radius_of_circle = int(input("Enter the value of radius of the circle : "))

area_of_circle = round((math.pi* pow(radius_of_circle,2)),2)

print(f"the value of area of circle with radius {radius_of_circle} is {area_of_circle}")





#Q2: Temperature of a city in Fahrenheit degrees is input through the keyboard.
#Write a program to convert this temperature into Centigrade degrees. 

temprature_in_fahrenheit = float(input("Enter the temprature of the city in farenheit "))
#°C = (°F – 32) x 5/9
temprature_in_centigrade = round(((temprature_in_fahrenheit - 32)* 5/9),2)
print(f"the temprature in degree centigrade is {temprature_in_centigrade}")







#Q3: Write a Python Program to make a simple calculator that can add, subtract, multiply and divide 


a= int(input("Enter the number a: "))
b= int(input("Enter the number b: "))

multiplication = a*b
subst = a-b
add = a+b
div = a/b

print(f"The addition of the following numbers a: {a} and b:{b} is {add}")
print(f"The substraction of the following numbers a: {a} and b:{b} is {subst}")       
print(f"The division of the following numbers a: {a} and b:{b} is {div}")
print(f"The multiplication of the following numbers a: {a} and b:{b} is {multiplication}")





#Q4: Write a Python Program to calculate the square root

num = float(input("Enter the number you want sqrt of: "))
result = round(math.sqrt(num),2)
print(result)




#Q5: Write a Python Program to Solve the quadratic equation ax**2 + bx + c = 0
# Coeffients a, b and c are provided by the user


import math

a = float(input("Enter coefficient a: "))
b = float(input("Enter coefficient b: "))
c = float(input("Enter coefficient c: "))


x = (b**2) - (4*a*c)

if x >= 0:
    # Two real solutions
    sol1 = (-b + math.sqrt(x)) / (2*a)
    sol2 = (-b - math.sqrt(x)) / (2*a)
    print(f"The solutions are {sol1} and {sol2}")
else:
    print("The equation has no real roots.")





#Q6: Write a Python Program to find the area of triangle
# Three sides of the triangle a, b and c are provided by the user

a = int(input("Enter a: "))
b = int(input("Enter b: "))
c = int(input("Enter c: "))

# The formula is: A = √[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)], where A is the area and s is the semi-perimeter, calculated as s = (a + b + c) / 2

s = (a + b + c) / 2

area_of_triangle = math.sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))

print(f"The area of the triangle is: {area_of_triangle}")





#Q7: If a five-digit number is input through the keyboard,
# write a program to calculate the sum of its digits without using any loop. (Hint: Use the modulus operator ‘%’) 

digit = int(input("Enter a 5 digit number"))
x1 = digit%10
digit = digit //10

x2 = digit%10
digit = digit //10


x3 = digit%10
digit = digit //10


x4 = digit%10
digit = digit //10


x5 = digit%10
digit = digit //10


total = x1+x2+x3+x4+x5
print(total)





#Q8: Write a Python program to print the following string in a specific format


print("""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star,\n \t How i wonder what you are! \n \t \t Up above the world so high, \n \t \t Like a diamond in the sky. \n Twinkle, Twinkle, little star, \n \t How i wonder what you are""")





#Q9: Write a Python program to display your details like name, age, and address in three different lines.


name="Harivansh"
age= 22
address= "Muzaffarnagar UttarPradesh, India"
print(f"Name: {name} \n Age: {age} \n Address: {address}")





#Q10.Create a string containing both a single quote and  double quote

string = "This is a string in which i can write s' single quote because it is sorrounded by double quotes"




#Q11.Create a triple quoted string that contains single and double quotes. 
string2 = """This is a string in which i can write ' single quote and double quote"" because it is in the tripple quotes"""




#Q12.Create a character, then obtain its integer representation.

char = "a"
integer_rep = ord(char)
print(integer_rep)  




#Q13.Create a single string containing 5 copies of the string 'abc'.

single_string = "abc"*5
print(single_string)




#Q14.Use the multiplication operator to create a "line" of 50 dashes.
fifty_dashes = "-"*50
print(fifty_dashes)




#Q15.Convert a string to all upper case.

string = "harivansh bhardwaj is a good student at cdac noida"
print(string.upper())




#Q16 : Write a Python program to get a string made of the first 2 and the last 2 chars from a given a string.

string = "This is a string"
last2= string[-2:]
first2 = string[:2]
new_string= first2+last2
print(new_string)




# Q17: a Python program to get a string from a given string where all occurrences of its first char have been changed to '$', except the first char itself.
# Sample String : 'restart'
# Expected Result : 'resta$t'

s= input("Enter a string value: ")
first_char = s[0]
s_new = s.replace(first_char,"$")
s_new = first_char+s_new[1:]
print(s_new)




# Q18: Write a Python program to get a single string from two given strings, separated by a space and swap the first two characters of each string.
# Sample String : 'abc', 'xyz' 
# Expected Result : 'xyc abz'


stringa = 'abc'
stringb= 'xyz'
new_str1 = stringb[:2]+stringa[2:]
