# f = open("simple.txt",mode ="r")

# print(f.read())
# f.seek(0)



# # 2.   Write a program that counts lines and characters in a file. With your favorite text editor, 
# # code a Python module called mymod.py, which exports three top-level names:
# # a) A countLines(name) function that reads an input file and counts the number of lines in it 
# # b) A countChars(name) function that reads an input file and counts the number of characters in it 
# # c) A test(name) function that calls both counting functions with a given input fileÂ¬name. 
# # All three mymod functions should expect a filename string to be passed in.
# # Now, test your module interactively, using import and name qualification to fetch your exports.
